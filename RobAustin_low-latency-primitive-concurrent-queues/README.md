### Faster than ArrayBlockingQueue

![PerformanceComparison](https://raw.github.com/RobAustin/low-latency-primitive-concurrent-queues/master/src/test/resources/performance-comparison.png)
 
### Aim

The aim is to be extremely low latency with near zero [GC](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/gc-tuning-6-140523.html) overhead.


An example of how to use one of our low latency bounded queues.

```

// writer thread
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().execute(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        queue.add(1);
    }
});

// reader thread
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().execute(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        final int value = queue.take();
    }
});


```

### Maven Central
We are hosted at [Maven Central] (http://search.maven.org), one of the quickest ways to get up and running is to add this [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) dependency to your pom file :

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.co.boundedbuffer</groupId>
    <artifactId>low-latency-primitive-concurrent-queues</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
<dependency>
```

### Is this Queue Thread Safe ?

Yes - it's thread safe, but you are limited to using just two threads per queue instance, One producer thread and a consumer thread.

### Why am I limited to only using just two threads ?

The queues take advantage of the Unsafe.putOrderedX(), which provides non-blocking code with guaranteed writes. These writes will not be re-ordered by instruction reordering, they use a faster store-store barrier, rather than the the slower store-load barrier ( which is used when doing a volatile write ). One of the trade offs with this improved performance is the visibility of the reads and writes between cores.
