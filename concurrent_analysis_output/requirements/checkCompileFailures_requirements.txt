Okay, so I need to generate concise natural language requirements for the Java function checkCompileFailures. Let me start by understanding what the function does.

Looking at the source code, the function takes a templateFile and a CompilationResult. It first retrieves diagnostics from the result. If debugEnabled is true, it prints out the diagnostics. If the result isn't successful, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.

So, the function's main purpose is to check if the compilation was successful and handle any diagnostics, especially for debugging.

Now, for the input-output: the function has two parameters, templateFile which is a String, and result which is a CompilationResult. It doesn't return anything, so the return is void.

Dependencies: It uses println for printing, checks if the result is successful, gets diagnostics, checks if diagnostics are empty, and throws an IllegalArgumentException. Also, it uses StringWrappingJavaFile for the diagnostics.

Concurrency patterns: The function doesn't seem to use any concurrency primitives like locks or threads. It's using future patterns and thread-local storage, but in the code, I don't see any synchronization. So maybe it's intended to be called in a single-threaded context or relies on external concurrency control.

Putting it all together, I need to write the requirements in the specified format without including any code or explanations. I should focus on the function's purpose, inputs, outputs, dependencies, and concurrency aspects, keeping it brief and technical.

What the function does - Checks if a compilation result is successful and prints diagnostics if enabled.

Input-Output:
:param: templateFile (String) - Path to the template file being compiled.
:param: result (CompilationResult) - Compilation result containing success status and diagnostics.
:return: None

Dependencies - Relies on println for output, isSuccessful and getDiagnostics methods of CompilationResult, and IllegalArgumentException for error handling.

Concurrency patterns - Designed to be thread-safe using future patterns and thread-local storage.
