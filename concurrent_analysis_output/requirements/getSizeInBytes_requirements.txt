Okay, so I need to figure out the requirements for the getSizeInBytes function in Java. Let me start by looking at the function details provided. The function is called getSizeInBytes, and its signature is public int getSizeInBytes(). It's part of the Mapper class. 

Looking at the source code, it returns Primitive.INT.sizeInBytes plus the result of inspector.getSizeInBytes(). So, the function seems to be calculating the size in bytes by adding two values. One is a constant from Primitive.INT, and the other is obtained from an inspector object.

Now, the dependencies are listed as inspector.getSizeInBytes and getSizeInBytes. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The function itself is called getSizeInBytes, so maybe the dependency is on another method with the same name but in a different class, perhaps the inspector's method.

Next, the concurrency patterns mentioned are future_pattern and thread_local_storage. That suggests the function might be using futures for asynchronous computation and thread-local storage to keep data separate across threads.

There are no synchronization primitives listed, so maybe the function relies on other concurrency mechanisms rather than locks or semaphores.

Putting this together, the function's purpose is to compute the size in bytes by summing two values. It doesn't take any parameters and returns an int. It depends on the inspector's getSizeInBytes method. For concurrency, it uses futures and thread-local storage to handle thread safety without using traditional synchronization primitives.

I should structure the requirements accordingly, making sure each section is concise and focuses on the technical aspects without including any code or explanations.

What the function does - Computes the size in bytes by summing a constant value and the result of another method call.

Input-Output:
:return: The computed size in bytes as an integer.

Dependencies - Relies on the inspector.getSizeInBytes() method to obtain part of the size calculation.

Concurrency patterns - Utilizes future patterns for asynchronous computation and thread-local storage to maintain thread safety without using synchronization primitives.
