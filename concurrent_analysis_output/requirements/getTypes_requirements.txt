What the function does - Calculates the total size in bytes by summing the size of an integer and the size returned by an inspector.

Input-Output:
:param: None
:return: int - The total size in bytes.

Dependencies - Relies on the inspector object's getSizeInBytes() method and the Primitive.INT.sizeInBytes constant.

Concurrency patterns - Utilizes the future pattern for asynchronous operations and thread-local storage to manage variables per thread, enhancing concurrency without needing synchronization.
